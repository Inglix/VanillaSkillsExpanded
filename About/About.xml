  <description>Vanilla Skills Expanded is a new mod that expands on the vanilla skills system by introducing expertise to the extremely broad skill categories that vanilla has. Only 1 expertise per pawn can be gained. Expertise can only be gained in skills with both a passion and more than 15 levels. In addition, other mods can add more to account for their own additions of tasks.

Expertise will allow your pawns to truly excel in specific skills that fit their abilities and backstories. From planet-known roofers and architects to professional chefs and master duelists, this mod aims to add much more character to all the pawns.

Expertise is a permanent choice, so be careful what you pick!

This mod also introduces three new passion types - critical passion, natural passion and apathy!</description>
